This fighter jet model was created by Lars Forssell and Ulrik Nilsson from the Swedish Defence Research Agency. Their [report](https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI-R--1624--SE) describes the development of this research project. Their MATLAB codes used to be accessible, but were removed from their original website before 2020. We make these codes available again here.

# ADMIRE

This project contains the MATLAB codes for the ADMIRE fighter jet model. This model has been created by Lars Forssell and Ulrik Nilsson from the Swedish Defence Research Agency. Their [report](https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI-R--1624--SE) describes the development of this research project. Their MATLAB codes used to be accessible, but were removed from their original website before 2020. We make these codes available again here.
